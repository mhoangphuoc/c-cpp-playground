/* Exercise 30: *Division Check*

### Problem:
Given three 64-bit integers $a, b,$ and $c$. Determine if any of the following conditions are met:
- $a / b = c$ (where $a$ is divisible by $b$)
- $b / c = a$ (where $b$ is divisible by $c$)
- $c / a = b$ (where $c$ is divisible by $a$)

### Input:
Three 64-bit integers $a, b, c$ $(-10^{18} \le a, b, c \le 10^{18})$.

### Output:
Print `/` if at least one condition is satisfied, otherwise print `NOSOL`. */
